```

# >Package to .exe

##### Follow the Step!

1. Open the console in the root directory of the project
2. Check whether you can successfully run this program on python
3. Install pyinstaller on your PC
4. Package with pyinstaller
5. Copy all files in the 'copy' folder to the root directory of .exe files (not a single 'copy' folder!)

##### Installation via pip

```
pip install pyinstaller==4.5.1
```

##### Packaging command

Full version

```
pyinstaller -D Preparation.py -i ICOV4.ico --upx-dir UPX -y -n RBS_Software2021  --key ZKPuichingMemory -w --collect-submodules pynput
```

Lightweight version

```
pyinstaller -D Preparation.py -y -n RBS_Software2021 -w --collect-submodules pynput
```

##### tips

1. ICO files and other image files are required for the packaging program. Make sure they are in the correct location (the default location is usually correct)
2. Packaging when not all files are ready can cause errors.
3. Upx encapsulation is required for packaging. Please prepare a folder named 'UPX' in the root directory.
4. Download of upx >>>[https://github.com/upx/upx](https://github.com/upx/upx)
5. If you choose lightweight installation, you don't need to consider all the above things.ðŸ¤£
